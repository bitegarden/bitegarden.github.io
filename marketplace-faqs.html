            <h2>
              What's the bitegarden Marketplace?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The <a href="https://marketplace.bitegarden.com">bitegarden Marketplace</a> is a platform for SonarQube
              customers to discover, try, and buy plugins for Sonar products. You can use plugins to customize and extend
              your Sonar product. The Marketplace offers plugins developed by both bitegarden and third-party developers.
            </p>

            <h2>
              What's a plugin?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Plugins are small pieces of code that you (or your administrator) can install into your Sonar product
              to enhance or change its functionality. Plugins can also be remotely contained web applications that
              integrate into cloud sites. You can enable, disable, install, and uninstall plugins anytime from the
              administration pages of your Sonar product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plugins change the way your Sonar product behaves. Even though plugins are designed to enhance
              your product, there can be unintended effects. When you use or install plugins, you do so at your
              own risk. While third-party plugins aren’t supported by bitegarden’s technical support team,
              many vendors provide support via their own support portals. Learn more on each plugin’s marketplace listing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Marketplace sells plugins written by both bitegarden and third-party developers. You can even
              <a href="https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/extension-guide/developing-a-plugin/plugin-basics/" target="_blank">write
                one yourself.</a>

            <h2>
              Are all plugins available for both cloud and server installations?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Platform availability is at the discretion of the plugin creator. Each Marketplace plugin listing will
              reflect cloud or server availability.
            </p>

            <h2>
              How are apps reviewed?
            </h2>
            <p>
              bitegarden checks entries in the bitegarden Marketplace to ensure that app information is as complete as
              possible. However, we don't actively monitor or guarantee any code posted in this space.
              If you find dangerous or malicious code posted here, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> immediately so we can take action.

            <h2>
              Can I trust third-party apps?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Because Marketplace plugins are offered by third-party Marketplace vendors, install a plugin only if you
              trust the plugin and the Marketplace vendor. On the Marketplace, you can find information about how apps handle data on the
              Privacy & Security tab on the plugin’s listing on bitegarden Marketplace. Please take care to evaluate plugins
              against your company’s privacy, security and compliance requirements, as you are entering into an
              independent relationship with the Marketplace vendor, separate from your relationship with bitegarden or Sonar.

              There are multiple factors to consider when evaluating third-party plugins. Some of these include:
              - Security
              - Data management and privacy
              - Support
              - Assurance and trust
            </p>

            <h2>
              Are plugins supported?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It depends on the plugin. bitegarden Marketplace vendors are able to decide if they would like to provide
              support and maintenance for every plugin listing. We make this information available on every listing in the
              bitegarden Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the bitegarden Marketplace vendor has decided to provide customer support and maintenance for the plugin,
              the listing will show that the plugin is "Supported". Should you need support for the plugin, you should contact
              the plugin vendor via the "Get Support" button on the support tab of the plugin listing details page. If the
              bitegarden Marketplace vendor is bitegarden, the "Get Support" button will take you to bitegarden’s support
              ticketing system (support.bitegarden.com). All other requests go to a support resource provided by the
              Marketplace vendor. We’ve found this to be the fastest way to get your issues resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marketplace vendros have different hours of operations and service level agreements than those
              provided by bitegarden Support, regardless of your Sonar support tier. If you'd like to give bitegarden
              feedback about your support experience with Marketplace vendors, please contact us through our contact form.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Marketplace vendor has decided not to provide customer support and/or maintenance, the
              plugin listing will show "Unsupported". Should you need support for an unsupported plugin, you should raise a
              request with the online community (community.sonarsource.com). Please note that there are no guarantees for
              issue resolution with unsupported plugins from the Marketplace vendor or bitegarden.

            <h2>
              Can plugins make my product slower?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes, yes. It's possible for a plugin to cause performance problems. For this reason,
              we recommend learning all you can about a plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can try a plugin in a staging environment before deploying it in production. You can also use customer
              reviews to learn what other users have to say. Visit the website of the plugin vendor and review any support
              materials they have.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you suspect a plugin is causing a problem in your Sonar product, try disabling the plugin to see if the
              issue persists.

            <h2>
              How do I manage a plugin?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Administrators have full access to monitor and manage plugins. To view, update, and configure plugins
              in your site, administrators can use our Universal Plugin Manager (UPM).
            </p>
            <p>
              For information on how to use UPM, please see our <a href="sonarqube-upm">Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) documentation</a>.

            <h2>
              What's plugin archiving?
            </h2>
            <p>
              To focus on current, relevant plugins, the bitegarden Marketplace regularly archives plugins that are out-of-date
              or, for any other reason, no longer relevant to the Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              Archiving prevents the plugins from appearing in search results or in-plugin browsing lists. The Marketplace
              archives plugins automatically if the time since the end-of-life of the latest version of the Sonar
              product it supports is greater than one year.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you already have a license for an archived plugin, you can still download the plugin from its Marketplace
              listing and use it. However, new licenses for the plugin are not available. Contact the vendor to inquire
              about an updated version of the plugin.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>
             What information can plugins access in my SonarQube&trade; instance?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The actions a plugin can perform and the information a plugin can request in your Sonar instance
              vary depending on the plugin and are at the discretion of the Marketplace vendor. This is
              because plugins have different requirements depending on their function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some plugins have a longer, more granular and detailed list of actions and information they can request in
              order to ensure they are only requesting information they absolutely need. These plugins also provide more
              detailed information to customers about the specific actions and information required.
            </p>
            <p>
              A longer list of plugins actions does not mean a plugin has access to more of your SonarQube instance. Contact
              the Marketplace vendor to request the list of actions they request in their plugins.

            <h2>
              How are the plugins licensed?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Plugins are priced per instance and per year. An instance is an installation of SonarQube&trade; Server or an
              organization of SonarQube&trade; Cloud.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>
              Do I need a plugin license for each environment of my Sonar products?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Yes; Marketplace plugins are licensed per environment. For self-managed installations (SonarQube&trade; Server), a plugin license is
              required for each unique environment. If you have a Data Center product running on multiple servers as a cluster,
              this counts as one environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              For cloud, plugins are licensed per cloud organization.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Where do I get license keys for my new plugin?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Plugin license keys will be sent to you once payment has been received and the unique key of your instance
              or organization is provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              For SonarQube&trade; Server you will need to provide your Server ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              For SonarQube&trade; Cloud you will need to provide your Organization Key.
