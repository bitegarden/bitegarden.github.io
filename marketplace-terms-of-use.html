              Welcome to the <strong>bitegarden Marketplace</strong>! The bitegarden Marketplace is an online marketplace for cloud and
              downloadable software applications, plugins and extensions (“<strong>Marketplace Plugins</strong>” or “<strong>Plugins</strong>”) that are
              designed to interoperate with SonarSource software and cloud offerings (“<strong>Sonar Products</strong>”).
            </p>
            <p>
              SonarQube™ and SonarCloud™ are trademarks belonging to SonarSource SA, a Swiss company with its address
              at Route de Pré-Bois 1, CH - 1214, Vernier, Switzerland, with UID Registration No. CHE-114.587.664
              (“<strong>SonarSource</strong>”, “<strong>Sonar</strong>”). For further information, please

            </p>
            <p>
              Use of the bitegarden Marketplace is governed by these bitegarden Marketplace Terms of Use
              (“<strong>Terms of Use</strong>”), which form a legally binding agreement between you (defined in Section 1.1)
              and BITEGARDEN SOLUTIONS SL, a Spanish corporation (ESB40612251) (“<strong>bitegarden</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”).
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600">
              By placing an Order for a Plugin, or accessing or using the bitegarden Marketplace, you indicate your
              assent to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not place an
              Order or use or access the bitegarden Marketplace.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h1>
              1. Introduction
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>1.1. Who are You?</strong> Because all Plugins available through the bitegarden Marketplace are designed for
              use with Sonar Products, in these Terms of Use, “<strong>you</strong>” refers to the Sonar customer or user (e.g.,
              person or entity) who holds a license or subscription to the Sonar Product with which the Plugin
              will be enabled or used. That Sonar customer is fully responsible for compliance with these
              Terms of Use by anyone using the bitegarden Marketplace or placing Orders on its behalf.
              Any person using the bitegarden Marketplace or placing an Order on behalf of a Sonar customer
              is binding that Sonar customer to these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use also apply to you if
              you are browsing the Marketplace or leaving a review.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.2. Types of Plugins.</strong> Some Marketplace Plugins are made available at no charge, and
              others require payment of fees. The listing for each Plugin will identify the provider of the Plugin
              (“<strong>Vendor</strong>”), which may be bitegarden or a third party. Plugin for which bitegarden is
              the Vendor are “<strong>bitegarden Plugins</strong>” and Plugins for which the Vendor is a third party are “<strong>Third Party Plugins</strong>”.
              Most Vendors are third parties, who create, own and are responsible for their own Plugins as further
              described in these Terms of Use. In all cases, you may only use Plugins with the Sonar Products with which they are designed to be
              used (as identified in the Plugin’s listing).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.3. Finding Plugins and Placing Orders.</strong> We want it to be easy to find great Plugins
              throughout your Sonar experience. Therefore, “bitegarden Marketplace” includes <a href="https://marketplace.bitegarden.com" target="_blank">marketplace.bitegarden.com</a>
              and any other webpage, application, interface, service or in-product experience at which we make
              available or list Plugins (such as our <a href="https://www.bitegarden.com/sonarqube-upm">Universal Plugin Manager</a>). Likewise, when we refer to “Orders”,
              that includes any order, purchase, installation, trial, download or enablement of a Plugin (including renewals and upgrades), whether through the bitegarden Marketplace, Sonar Products or other processes
              or interfaces we make available. All Orders are subject to these Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.4. Marketplace Policies.</strong>Your Orders and use of the bitegarden Marketplace are also subject to
              bitegarden’s marketplace <a href="/marketplace-faqs/">FAQs</a> and posted policies, as may be modified from time to time
              (“<strong>Marketplace Policies</strong>”), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use.

              2. Your Orders
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>2.1. Order Details.</strong> Your Order will identify the Vendor, your authorized scope of use of
              the Plugin (such as the platform) and license or subscription term, as applicable. Once you complete your
              Order, bitegarden will provide with you access to the applicable Plugin, including any relevant license or
              access keys, as described in the Marketplace Policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.2. Paid Plugins.</strong> To receive access to paid Plugins, you must pay bitegarden the fees,
              including all taxes, indicated at the time of your Order. Terms for renewals, including pricing, will be
              described within the Plugin’s listing on the bitegarden Marketplace (or if different, your Order). You can
              disable renewals but you will not receive any refunds except as described in Section 2.3). For any Third
              Party Plugin, you acknowledge and agree that bitegarden is the Vendor’s commercial agent and that you are
              required to make any related payments directly to bitegarden (and your sales contract with bitegarden
              includes these Terms of Use and the applicable Order). However, after you complete your Order, your usage
              of any Third Party Plugins will be governed by the applicable Vendor Terms, as described in Section 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: this Section 2.2 does not apply to Paid-via-Vendor Apps (see Section 2.5 below).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.3. Return Policy.</strong> Returns and refunds of bitegarden Plugins are governed by the
              bitegarden Terms, as defined in Section 3.1(b). For Third Party Plugins, you have thirty (30) days from
              the date you place your Order to cancel your Order and return the Plugin. If you cancel your Order of a
              Third Party Plugin within this 30-day period, bitegarden will refund the amount you paid for the
              applicable Third Party Plugin, and you must cease using the Plugin and delete any copies of the Plugin in
              your possession. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.3, all Orders are non-cancelable and
              non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: this Section 2.3 does not apply to Paid-via-Vendor Apps (see Section 2.5 below).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.4. Trial Periods.</strong> The bitegarden Marketplace may offer free trial periods for Plugins. After expiration
              of the trial period, if you do not place an Order for the Plugin, the Plugin will cease to function and
              you must cease using and delete your copies of the Plugin and any related license or access keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.5. Paid-via-Vendor Plugin.</strong> While most Plugins are provisioned by bitegarden as described in Section 2.1,
              some Third Party Plugins may be enabled or paid for through a third party Vendor’s own website
              (“<strong>Paid-via-Vendor Plugins</strong>”). Paid-via-Vendor Plugins will be identified in their listings or when you
              enable or pay for the Plugin. Section 2.2 (Paid Plugins) and Section 2.3 (Return Policy) do not apply to
              Paid-via-Vendor Plugins and returns, if any, would be governed by the applicable Vendor Terms.

              3. Use of Marketplace Plugins
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>3.1. Vendor Terms.</strong> Without limiting the disclaimers, restrictions or other provisions in these Terms of
              Use, usage of Plugins is subject to the license or subscription terms, privacy policies and other
              applicable terms specified by the Vendor (“<strong>Vendor Terms</strong>”), including any usage limits described therein.
              Vendor Terms are typically included on the Plugin’s listing page or presented through the Order process.
              You may not use a Plugin if you do not agree to the relevant Vendor Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(a) Third Party Plugins. Third Party Plugins are subject to the third party’s Vendor Terms, not
                the bitegarden Terms. By ordering, installing or enabling any Third Party Plugin, you are entering into
                the Vendor Terms directly with the applicable third party Vendor.</strong> bitegarden is not a party to,
              or responsible for compliance with, any third party Vendor Terms, and does not guarantee any third party
              Vendor Terms are adequate for your own needs. Please see Section 4 (Data Collection and Sharing) for
              additional information about how third party Vendors use your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(b) bitegarden Plugins.</strong> If bitegarden is the Vendor of the Plugin, the Vendor Terms are
              the bitegarden terms that govern the bitegarden Product with which the Plugin is enabled or used (listed
              <a href="https://www.bitegarden.com/pdf/bitegarden-terms-and-conditions.pdf">here</a>) and as may be modified from
              time to time (the “<strong>bitegarden Terms</strong>”). The bitegarden Terms include the bitegarden Privacy Policy. In
              event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the bitegarden Terms, the bitegarden Terms will control
              as to each party’s rights and responsibilities related to the Plugin itself, while these Terms of Use will
              control as to the bitegarden Marketplace generally.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.2. Support and Maintenance.</strong> Any support and maintenance of Third Party Plugins will be provided by the
              applicable Vendor and only to the extent described in the applicable Vendor Terms. bitegarden is not
              responsible for any support and maintenance for Third Party Plugins, and a Vendor’s failure to provide any
              support or maintenance does not entitle you to any refund. If bitegarden is the Vendor, it will provide
              any support and maintenance in accordance with the bitegarden Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.3. Reservation of Rights.</strong> Except for the rights explicitly granted to you in these Terms of Use and in
              the Vendor Terms for each Plugin, all right, title and interest (including intellectual property rights)
              in the bitegarden Marketplace are reserved by bitegarden, and all right, title and interest (including
              intellectual property rights) in the Plugins are reserved and retained by their respective Vendors and
              licensors. Plugins are provided on a license or subscription basis, not sold, and you do not acquire any
              ownership rights in the bitegarden Marketplace or the Plugins.

              4. Data Collection and Sharing
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>4.1. Order Information.</strong> If you order a Marketplace Plugin through bitegarden, bitegarden will provide the
              Vendor with the information you provide in completing the order, such as your name, company name (if any),
              addresses (including e-mail address) and phone number.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4.2. Third Party Vendor Use of Data.</strong> As referenced in the bitegarden Terms, if you place an Order for
              Third Party Plugins, you authorize Vendors to access or use certain data in the applicable Sonar Products.
              This may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting such data, or storing such data on
              Vendor or third party systems. Any third party Vendor’s use of accessed data (whether data in the Sonar
              Products or separately collected from you or your device) is subject to the applicable Vendor Terms.
              <strong>bitegarden is not responsible for any access, use, transfer or security of data or information by third
              party Vendors or by Third Party Plugins, or for the security or privacy practices of any third party
              Vendor or such Vendor's Third Party Plugins and third party processors. You are solely responsible for
              your decision to permit any third party Vendor or Third Party Plugin to access or use data to which you’ve
              granted access.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4.3. bitegarden Use of Marketplace Data.</strong> Any data that bitegarden collects from you based on your use of
              the bitegarden Marketplace and your Orders, or that it receives from third party Vendors on your behalf
              (e.g., order details related to purchases under Section 2.5 (Paid-via-Vendor Plugins)), is subject to the
              bitegarden Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4.4. Analytics and Usage Data.</strong> In addition, you authorize the Vendor and bitegarden (if bitegarden is not
              the Vendor) to collect and use technical data and related information (including technical information
              relating to your device, system, and the Plugin), in non-personally identifiable form, to facilitate the
              provision of software updates, product support, marketing efforts and other services to you related to the
              Plugin. Vendor and bitegarden (if bitegarden is not the Vendor) may each use this information, as long as
              it is in a form that does not personally identify individual users, to improve their respective products
              or to provide services or technology to you (including with respect to bitegarden, the bitegarden
              Marketplace and Sonar Products).

              5. Reviews of Marketplace Plugins
            </h1>
            <p>
              The bitegarden Marketplace allows users to post reviews (e.g., a star rating) of Marketplace Plugins and
              to post comments on your or other users’ reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.1. User Names Displayed.</strong> Reviews and comments are posted under the name and profile of
              the user submitting the content (as listed in his or her bitegarden Marketplace account). Users who do not
              want their names or other profile information (such as profile photographs) to appear may not post reviews
              or comments on the bitegarden Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.2. Rules for Reviews.</strong> All reviews and comments must comply with bitegarden’s <a
                    href="/marketplace-acceptable-use">Acceptable
              Use Policy</a> and the terms below. To make your reviews and comments useful to others:
            </p>
            <p>
              • Reviews must be made in good faith after reasonable evaluation of the relevant Plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Users may post only one review per Plugin, unless the latter review reflects a good-faith rating change
              based on further evaluation. Any modified reviews will be marked as “edited”.
            </p>
            <p>
              • You (including anyone acting on your behalf) may not review or comment on your own Plugin, a Plugin
              owned by a company you work for, or those of competitors. As an exception, you may provide informational
              responses to support requests or other inquiries directed to you within the reviews or comments section of
              your Plugin listing.
            </p>
            <p>
              • A Review must evaluate the Plugin itself and not be an evaluation of the underlying product with which
              the Plugin integrates or functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Reviews or comments unrelated to the relevant Plugin are prohibited – for example, discussing
              bitegarden’s employees, business or stock, or those of other companies, or unrelated products or services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.3. bitegarden Rights.</strong> bitegarden reserves the right, in its sole discretion and for any
              reason at any time, to remove or edit any review or comment on the bitegarden Marketplace. bitegarden does
              not claim ownership of the content of reviews or comments you post on the bitegarden Marketplace. However,
              you hereby grant bitegarden a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable,
              sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use, distribute,
              reproduce, modify, excerpt, attribute, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display that content (in whole
              or in part) and to incorporate it into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed,
              and to permit others to do so.

              8. Important Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>8.1. Third Party Plugins.</strong> A significant portion of the Marketplace Plugins in the bitegarden Marketplace
              are provided by parties other than bitegarden. Third party Vendors are solely responsible for their
              Plugins and any related content or materials included in their Plugins. <strong>bitegarden has no liability or
              responsibility whatsoever for any Third Party Plugins, including their accuracy, reliability,
              availability, security, data handling, data processing, completeness, usefulness or quality, even if
              bitegarden is hosting such Plugin. These disclaimers apply even if a Plugin complies with bitegarden’s
              guidelines for Third Party Plugins (located on bitegarden’s web properties such as
              www.bitegarden.com/developer), and even if bitegarden has reviewed, certified, or approved the Third Party
              Plugin. Any use of Third Party Plugins is at your sole discretion and risk. Vendors are solely responsible
              for ensuring that any information they submit is accurate, complete and correct, and bitegarden is not
              responsible for the standards or business practices of any third party Vendor (whether support,
              availability, security or otherwise. You should always independently verify that any Third Party Plugins
                  or Vendor business practices meet your needs.</strong> In addition, bitegarden is not responsible for any third
              party websites to which the bitegarden Marketplace links or their terms of use or privacy policies. You
              should use your discretion when visiting third party websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.2. Removal of Plugins.</strong> At any time, bitegarden may remove a Plugin from the bitegarden Marketplace in
              accordance with its applicable policies, and Vendors may also update, modify or remove their own Plugins
              at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.3. Interoperability.</strong> bitegarden makes no guarantee that any Plugins will work properly with Sonar
              Products or that Plugins will continue to work with Sonar Products as they change over time. Some Plugins
              rely on hosted or cloud services provided by the Vendor or third parties, and these Plugins may not
              function properly or may become inoperable if those services are discontinued.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.4. Disclaimer of Warranties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, bitegarden offers the bitegarden
              Marketplace and all Third Party Plugins “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, and bitegarden hereby disclaims all
              warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranties of
              title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, relating to the bitegarden
              Marketplace or this Agreement. You may have other statutory rights, in which case the duration of any
              statutory warranties will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.5. Limitations of Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will bitegarden be
              liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other liability related to
              the bitegarden Marketplace or any Third Party Plugins, including for any loss of use, lost or inaccurate
              data, failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business or costs of delay. If the foregoing
              disclaimer of direct damages is not enforceable at law for any reason, in no event will bitegarden’s
              aggregate liability to you under these Terms of Use exceed the greater of (1) the amount you paid to
              bitegarden for the Third Party Plugin related to your claim, or (2) fifty euros (50 €).</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.6. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability for bitegarden Plugins.</strong> Section 8.4 (Disclaimer of
              Warranties) and 8.5 (Limitations of Liability) do not alter the disclaimers or limitations of liability
              for bitegarden Plugins in the bitegarden Terms, which continue to fully apply.

            <p>
              <strong>8.7. Basis of Bargain; Failure of Essential Purpose.</strong> bitegarden entered into these Terms of Use relying on
              the limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranty and other provisions relating to allocation of risk
              herein, and you agree that such provisions are an essential basis of the bargain between the parties. You
              agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 8 apply regardless of the form of action,
              whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply
              even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms of Use is found to have failed of its essential
              purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8.8. bitegarden Affiliates and Contractors.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that bitegarden’s affiliates,
              contractors and service providers may exercise all rights of bitegarden under these Terms of Use, and that
              all limitations of liability and disclaimers in these Terms of Use apply fully to and benefit bitegarden’s
              affiliates.

              these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. bitegarden’s failure to enforce any provision of
