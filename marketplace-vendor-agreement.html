                    <p>
                        The bitegarden Marketplace is a forum for connecting partners who make Apps for SonarQube&trade;
                        products with potential end users. Apps can be written using the Sonar Developer Extensions and
                        can be
                        written for use with Sonar’s downloaded server or cloud products. As a vendor, you may
                        charge a fee for your Apps and designate whether end users may order your Apps through
                        bitegarden’s ordering and license management system (in which case revenue sharing will apply).
                        You may also offer your Apps free of charge under certain circumstances.

                    or subscriptions to your Paid-via-bitegarden Apps (the “<strong>List Prices</strong>”), all in accordance with bitegarden
                    standard formulas and policies. “<strong>Sale</strong>” includes any initial or renewal sale, subscription or license of a Paid-via-bitegarden App (or

                    Paid-via-bitegarden App at the applicable discount to the List Price as described in our Marketplace

                <p>
                    Subject to this Agreement, for each Sale, except as otherwise expressly agreed by bitegarden in writing,
                    bitegarden will pay you the applicable Revenue Share for the Sale.  Such amounts exclude taxes and
                    any separately stated fees or charges. A Revenue Share is due only for Sales for which bitegarden
                    has received final payment from or on behalf of an end user. If an App is sold to an end user
                    using a credit card, final payment will be deemed to have occurred when the applicable credit card
                    company or bank has fully settled the payment for the applicable purchase. The current Revenue Share
                    pages may be amended from time to time by bitegarden.
                    Any changes or updates to the Revenue Share will be effective 30 days after notice.

                    Unless otherwise specified in the Marketplace Guidelines, you will
                    designate your List Price in Euros (€) and bitegarden will make all Revenue Share
                    payments to you in Euros. In certain non-European countries, bitegarden may, in its discretion,
                    list your Apps and make Sales to end users in currencies other than Euros. In this case, your Euros
                    denominated Revenue Share payment may fluctuate, and bitegarden will make the applicable currency
                    conversions for your Revenue Share payment in accordance with documentation on the Marketplace
                    website and communications to you.

                <p>
                    Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 4), approximately
                    thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable Sale is made, bitegarden
                    will pay you the Revenue Share due to you and provide you with a report that gives further
                    information about your Sales of your Paid-via-bitegarden Apps. You agree to provide bitegarden with
                    information on a valid bank account in your name, and bitegarden will make payments to that account
                    via Electronic Funds Transfer (“EFT”). bitegarden is entitled to accrue and withhold payments,
                    without interest, until the total amount due to you (net of any tax withholding, as further
                    described below) is at least 500 € (or equivalent). You agree that any fees charged by your
                    bank in connection with wire transfers pursuant to this Section 4.4 are solely your responsibility.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    bitegarden may issue refunds of the applicable Sale
                    amount (or portions thereof) to end users or bitegarden Vendors in its sole discretion. If bitegarden
                    issues a refund prior to paying you the Revenue Share for the applicable Sale, then you agree and
                    acknowledge that you will not receive and will have no right to receive a Revenue Share on that
                    portion of the Sale amount that was refunded. In addition, if bitegarden pays you a Revenue Share on
                    a Sale and later issues a refund or credit to the end user for such Sale (or receives a chargeback
                    related to the Sale), bitegarden may offset the amount of the Revenue Share that bitegarden previously
                    paid you against future Revenue Share or other amounts that would otherwise be payable to you under
                    this Agreement, or require you to remit that amount to bitegarden. bitegarden may also withhold and
                    offset sums you owe to bitegarden against amounts that are payable to you. When this Agreement
                    terminates, bitegarden may withhold all Revenue Share due for a period of sixty (60) days from the
                    date they would otherwise be payable, in order to ensure bitegarden’s ability to offset any end user
                    refunds or make any other offsets to which bitegarden is entitled.

                    bitegarden shall only use your banking and payment information for purposes related to this Section
                    4 (Financial Terms). bitegarden shall not disclose your sales and related financial data to third
                    parties except agents and contractors acting on bitegarden’s behalf and except as required by Laws.
                    The foregoing sentence notwithstanding, bitegarden may use or disclose aggregated sales and other
                    financial data related to the bitegarden Marketplace, which may include your sales and related

                <p>
                    bitegarden is responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes imposed on sales of
                    Paid-via-bitegarden Apps to end users. You are responsible for any income or other taxes due and
                    payable resulting from bitegarden’s payments to you. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the
                    amounts due to you hereunder are exclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. bitegarden
                    maintains the right to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts due from
                    bitegarden, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full
                    payment to you. For vendors in Spain, if you do not provide bitegarden with your CIF/VAT
                    number, then bitegarden has the right to withhold the top applicable tax rate from its Revenue Share
                    payments to you.

                    good faith after reasonable evaluation of the full Marketplace App. You (including your employees
                    and others acting on your behalf) may not review or comment on your own App or those of competitors.
                    As an exception, you may provide informational responses to support requests or other inquiries
                    directed to you within the reviews or comments section of your App. All reviews must comply with
                    bitegarden’s AUP, and bitegarden (in its discretion) may take down reviews or block reviewers in event
                    of a violation of the AUP.

                    <strong>8.3. bitegarden Marketplace Operations.</strong> bitegarden maintains sole discretion to determine all features
                    and operations of the bitegarden Marketplace. You acknowledge that bitegarden has no obligation to
                    promote, distribute, list or offer for Sale any Marketplace App, or to continue to do so. With
                    respect to Paid-via-bitegarden Apps only, bitegarden is responsible for and has sole discretion
                    related to processing payments, collecting payments, addressing requests for refunds, and providing
                    customer service related to its obligations, and, for clarity, all Sales through the bitegarden
                    Marketplace will be processed by bitegarden’s payment systems and will be subject to the Revenue
                    Share terms above. bitegarden will have sole ownership and control of all Sales and other data
                    bitegarden obtains from end users in connection with the bitegarden Marketplace, but will make
                    available certain End User Data (as defined below) to you, subject to Section 8.4.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>8.4. End User Data and Privacy‐Related Obligations.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(a) End User Data.</strong> An end user may enable you or your Apps to access End User Data. Based on the
                    activities under this Agreement, the Sonar platform where the Apps run may provide you with access to End User Data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(b) Collection and Use.</strong> You must obtain all necessary rights, permissions, and consents from end
                    users for your access, collection, storage, transmission, treatment, use, disclosure, sharing, and
                    other processing of any End User Data, and will ensure that all such processing complies with your
                    End User Terms, End User Privacy Policy, and all Laws. If you retrieve End User Data directly from
                    Sonar (e.g., end user information or code) via Sonar-provided APIs, portals or other similar
                    means, you must limit your access and processing of such information to that (a) authorized by the
                    end user or (b) necessary for the purposes of providing the functionality of your App. You may not
                    sell any End User Data. bitegarden shall not be liable for, or have any responsibility in connection
                    with, End User Data processed by you or your App, and such activities with regard to End User Data
                    are not in any way by or on behalf of bitegarden.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(c) End User Communications.</strong> You may use End User Data to communicate directly with end users only
                    where required by Law or as consented to or requested by the end user. But you may not send
                    marketing messages to end users within any user experience integrated with bitegarden Products
                    without bitegarden’s express written consent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(d) End User Terms.</strong> You must ensure end users agree to your End User Terms, which must comply with
                    all Laws and clearly describe how the platform quotas and limits for Forge Apps or any other
                    applicable usage limits may impact an end user’s use of your Apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(e) End User Privacy Policy.</strong> You must provide a clear, complete, and conspicuous End User Privacy
                    Policy that notifies end users (1) how you access, collect and process End User Data, (2) with whom
                    you share End User Data, (3) in which country or countries the End User Data will be stored and (4)
                    that you (not bitegarden) are responsible for your processing of End User Data, along with other
                    disclosures required by Laws. You must comply with the terms and conditions of your End User Privacy
                    Policy, and promptly notify end users and bitegarden of any material changes to it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(f) Security.</strong> You must use industry-standard security measures appropriate for all End User Data and
                    your processing activities, adequate to preserve End User Data’s confidentiality and security and
                    comply with all Laws. You will also comply with any security, coding practices, authentication,
                    encryption, or other requirements for Apps in the Security Requirements. You agree to remediate all
                    security vulnerabilities identified to you by bitegarden within the timeframes described in the
                    Security Requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(g) Security Incidents.</strong> Upon discovery or notice of any Security Incident, unless prohibited by
                    Laws, you will promptly (within 24 hours) notify bitegarden via the ticket creation link at support
                    portal. Your notice will provide bitegarden information about the
                    Security Incident and how it may affect bitegarden or Sonar Products, end users or End User Data, and you
                    agree to provide further information and assistance related to the Security Incident described in
                    the Marketplace Guidelines or as bitegarden may request. Without limiting your other obligations, in
                    event of a Security Incident, you will be solely responsible, at your own expense, for
                    investigation, remediation and your own notifications to affected end users and regulatory
                    authorities in accordance with Laws and industry standards. However, you must obtain bitegarden’s
                    approval for any breach notifications to end users that refer directly or indirectly to bitegarden.
                    You must ensure that you have an updated contact name and contact information in your developer
                    account for Security Incidents. Without limiting any other reserved rights of termination or
                    suspension, bitegarden may de-list your App from the bitegarden Marketplace or suspend use of or
                    access of your App to Sonar products as a result of any Security Incident.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(h) Security and Privacy Review.</strong> bitegarden, or an authorized third party selected by us, may conduct
                    a security or privacy review of any App or its supporting infrastructure to ensure compliance with
                    (i) your obligations under Section 8.4 or (ii) security and privacy related sections of the
                    Marketplace Guidelines. Security and privacy reviews may include, without limitation: information
                    requests to you, reviews of your documentation, interviews, security testing, technical testing and
                    reviews, code reviews and scans (which may reverse engineer binary code), event logging, network
                    testing, and vulnerability threat assessments. In addition, bitegarden reserves the right to request
                    that you provide the source code for your App, but solely for the purpose of bitegarden conducting
                    security and/or privacy tests. You agree to reasonably and promptly cooperate with such requests and
                    reviews of your App and/or your App’s supporting infrastructure (in the case of Cloud Apps).
                    bitegarden (itself or through third parties) may conduct new or additional App security scans beyond
                    those described in this Section 8.4(h), in which case bitegarden will provide you at least 15 days
                    prior notice and you may choose to opt-out of such scan with notice to bitegarden.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>8.5. Export Controls and Economic Sanctions.</strong> You acknowledge that you develop and offer Apps through
                    bitegarden via its Marketplace, and therefore you agree to strictly comply with all E.U. export
                    controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations in connection with these activities. You also
                    acknowledge that bitegarden and others may lawfully rely on your determination of your Marketplace
                    App’s export control status. Thus, you hereby represent, warrant, and certify that: (1) your
                    Marketplace Apps are authorized for export from the E.U. and re-export to each country to
                    which you permit them to be distributed or made available through the bitegarden Marketplace;
                    and (2) either (i) the Marketplace Apps do not contain, use or support any data encryption
                    or cryptographic functions (“Encryption Technology”) and have Export Control Classification Number
                    (“ECCN”) EAR99 or (ii) you have qualified each Marketplace App containing, using or supporting
                    Encryption Technology for export as a “mass market encryption item” having ECCN 5D992 in accordance
                    with 15 C.F.R Part 742.15(b)(2), as an item eligible for License Exception ENC pursuant to 15 C.F.R
                    Part 740.17(b)(1) having ECCN 5D002, or as an EAR99 item and will, upon request, provide bitegarden
                    with a copy of the applicable self-classification report or mass market export classification ruling
                    (CCATS), if applicable, issued by the United States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and
                    Security. You further agree to comply with any and all ongoing export-control and reporting
                    obligations, if applicable, related to any of your Marketplace Apps. You agree to indemnify
                    bitegarden of any claim brought against bitegarden for violation of any export-controls or economic
                    sanctions law or regulation related to your Marketplace Apps. You represent, warrant, and certify to
                    bitegarden that you will comply with all applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and
                    regulations.

                <p>
                    <strong>8.6. Feedback.</strong> Providing feedback, comments or suggestions about the bitegarden Marketplace
                    (“Feedback”) to bitegarden is wholly voluntary. bitegarden may freely use Feedback for any purpose.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>8.7. Aggregated Information.</strong> In addition to bitegarden’s other rights, bitegarden may collect
                    aggregated information regarding the bitegarden Marketplace and Marketplace Apps (excluding any
                    personally identifiable information). We will not provide information to any third party about
                    Marketplace Apps, or end users purchasing Marketplace Apps, except as necessary for us to perform
                    our obligations under this Agreement.

                <p>
                    <strong>8.8. App Programs.</strong> bitegarden may offers certain programs under which (i) Marketplace Vendors may
                    self-certify or (ii) bitegarden may approve that Marketplace Vendors, or their Apps, meet certain
                    standards for end user adoption, support, security and/or other criteria (“App Programs”).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(a)</strong> To participate in an App Program, you must complete an application, provide any additional
                    information requested by bitegarden. You represent and warrant that all
                    information you provide to bitegarden will be accurate and complete. bitegarden may disclose such
                    information to end users and other third parties in connection with administering the App Programs
                    and the Marketplace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(b)</strong> bitegarden may decide in its sole discretion whether to approve a Marketplace Vendor for an App
                    Program. If a Marketplace Vendor is approved, bitegarden may authorize the Marketplace Vendor to
                    use the related badge or other related marketing assets. Participation in any App Program, including
                    use of badges and marketing assets, is subject to the policies specified by bitegarden from time to
                    time. You understand that bitegarden may flag, revoke or downgrade any Marketplace Vendor
                    certification, approval or badge at any time based on end user complaints, Marketplace Vendor’s
                    failure to meet App Program standards, Marketplace Vendor’s failure to comply with bitegarden
                    policies or the Marketplace Guidelines, or otherwise in bitegarden’s discretion. Further, bitegarden
                    may rebrand, modify or discontinue any App Program, badges or related marketing assets at any time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(c)</strong> App Programs are designed to assist Marketplace Vendors in communicating certain standards and
                    business practices to end users of Apps, and bitegarden administers the App Programs only as a
                    convenience for Marketplace Vendors and end users. <strong>Marketplace Vendor remains solely responsible
                    for its Apps and their quality, sufficiency, security and support, notwithstanding bitegarden’s
                    approval, if granted, for a Marketplace Vendor to participate in an App Program or use any badge.</strong>
                    Without limiting its obligations in Section 8.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event will you
                    state or imply that bitegarden endorses, sponsors or guarantees your Apps.

                <p>
                    bitegarden may determine in its sole discretion to make available or list any Marketplace App through
                    the bitegarden Marketplace, or to remove any App from the bitegarden Marketplace. bitegarden may stop
                    any transaction, or take other actions as needed to restrict access to or availability of any
                    Content that does not comply with this Agreement or that otherwise might adversely affect end users.
                    Inclusion of a Marketplace App in the bitegarden Marketplace does not relieve you of responsibility
                    to ensure the Marketplace App complies with this Agreement or to perform other obligations under

                <p>
                    Marketplace Apps can be written or developed using the Sonar Platform (as described in the
                    Sonar documentation), and the development of Apps is subject to the separate Sonar Developer Terms
                    if any (including any product-specific terms incorporated therein). The Developer
                    Terms govern your use of the Sonar Platform and the creation and operation of Apps (or
                    “Add-ons” or "Plugins") generally, while this Agreement contains terms specific to the Marketplace and any Apps
                    you choose to submit to the Marketplace. Nothing in this Agreement changes the Sonar Developer
                    Terms (including any referenced policies or API call limits) or limits any of Sonar’s rights,
                    and you and your Apps must continue to comply with the Sonar
                    Developer Terms. However, in the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and the Sonar
                    Developer Terms, this Agreement will govern with respect to activities on the Marketplace.

                    termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with the applicable End User Terms. As
                    such, bitegarden may continue to make available any Apps for further access, downloads or
                    re-downloads by existing end users of those Apps for the duration of their applicable license,
                    subscription or maintenance term (including after the Transition Period) (the “Surviving Term”),

                    <strong>(c) Your Transition Obligations.</strong> If you are a Marketplace Vendor of Paid-via-bitegarden Apps, then
                    prior to expiration of the Transition Period (and otherwise in a timely manner) you are responsible
                    for doing the following, consistent with bitegarden’s guidance and instructions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(1)</strong> for Cloud Apps, making the App (including any New Versions) available to bitegarden and
                    Marketplace users on an stand-alone basis at least until the conclusion of any Surviving Terms for all end
                    users who have purchased such Apps;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(2)</strong> taking all actions necessary to move existing end users with Surviving Terms to your
                    non-bitegarden license mechanism, including, as applicable: (i) providing an equivalent product that
                    integrates to Sonar applications without the use of bitegarden, (ii) contacting end users
                    and providing access, installation and migration instructions, and equivalent license terms and key,
                    and/or (iii) providing end users with data migration tools and migration assistance;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(3)</strong> arranging to provide for ongoing support and maintenance (including New Versions) with respect
                    to your Apps for all end users who have purchased such rights for the duration of the term for which
                    you have committed to provide such support and maintenance; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(4)</strong> communicating such matters accurately and in a positive and professional manner to end users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the sake of clarity, after termination, you are not obligated to provide any New Versions of
                    your terminated App to bitegarden for distribution under this Agreement thereafter, but bitegarden’s
                    post-termination rights in this Section 11.3 will apply for the latest version of the App you
                    provided to bitegarden hereunder (and any prior version).

                    13. Indemnity
                </h1>
                <p>
                    13.1. By bitegarden. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (1) bitegarden shall
                    defend a Marketplace Vendor of a Paid-via-bitegarden App from claims by third parties alleging that
                    the bitegarden Marketplace itself, when used in connection with such App, infringes such third
                    party’s United States, European Union, or EU member state registered copyright or trademark and (2)
                    bitegarden shall pay damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction against such
                    Marketplace Vendor for such a claim or, if bitegarden settles the claim, the settlement amounts.
                    bitegarden’s obligations in this Section 13.1 apply only to the bitegarden Marketplace itself and not
                    to any Marketplace Apps, the Sonar Platform, other bitegarden products or services, or other
                    third party content hosted on or used with the bitegarden Marketplace, and in any case bitegarden’s
                    obligations do not apply if the alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation resulted from
                    any modifications, combinations, or unauthorized use of the bitegarden Marketplace. As a condition to
                    bitegarden’s obligations under this Section 13.1, you must provide bitegarden (i) prompt written
                    notice of the claim (and in any event notice in sufficient time for bitegarden to respond without
                    prejudice), (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, settlement and defense
                    (if applicable) of the claim, and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation. This Section 13.1 sets
                    forth bitegarden’s sole liability and your exclusive remedy with respect to third party claims of
                    intellectual property rights infringement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    13.2. By You. You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless bitegarden and its subsidiaries (including
                    its respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors and assigns) from and against
                    any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
                    arising out of any third party claim relating to (i) any Content or the use of Content (including
                    any claims made by or arising from end users), (ii) your breach or alleged breach of this Agreement,
                    or (iii) any Security Incidents caused by your Apps or third party services supporting your Apps
                    (individually, a “Claim,” and collectively, the “Claims”). In any defense or settlement
                    negotiations, you will keep bitegarden apprised of all relevant developments, including the choice of
                    counsel. bitegarden may participate in the defense or settlement of any Claim at its own expense. You
                    will provide bitegarden with reasonable notice of any judgment entered against bitegarden or any
                    settlement terms offered to settle a Claim and you will not consent to the entry of a judgment or
                    settle a Claim without bitegarden’s prior written consent, which we may not unreasonably withhold. If
                    you do not promptly assume and reasonably conduct the defense of a Claim or take reasonable action
                    to settle any such Claim after being provided with sufficient reasonable advance notice to evaluate
                    the Claim, then bitegarden may take control of the defense (without limiting your indemnification
                    obligations). Your obligations under this Section 13.2 are independent of your other obligations
                    under the Agreement.

                <p>
                    <strong>19.1. Informal Resolution.</strong> In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of
                    or relating to this Agreement, the parties will consult and negotiate with each other and,
                    recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If the
                    parties do not reach settlement within a period of sixty (60) days, either party may pursue relief
                    as may be available under this Agreement pursuant to Section 19.2 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction). All
                    negotiations pursuant to this Section 19.1 will be confidential and treated as compromise and
                    settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable
                    legislation and jurisdictions.

                <p>
                    <strong>19.2. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed
                    in accordance with the applicable laws of Spain, without giving effect to the
                    principles of that country relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal
                    action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought solely and
                    exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules
                    of Spain, and each party irrevocably submits
                    to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts in Spain,
                    generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by it or
                    against it by the other party.

                <p>
                    <strong>19.3. Injunctive Relief; Enforcement.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
                    19.1 (Informal Resolution) and 19.2 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction), nothing in this Agreement will
                    prevent bitegarden from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual
                    property rights, any Incident or other security issue, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or
                    recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>19.4. Exclusion of UN Convention and UCITA.</strong> The terms of the United Nations
                    Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer
                    Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where
                    adopted.

                <p>
                    This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties or as provided in Section
                    18 (Agreement Changes) above. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court with
                    jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, such provision will be deemed to be restated to
                    reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable
                    law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The word “including”
                    will be interpreted without limitation when used in this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
                    are independent contractors, not agents, joint venturers or partners, despite use of the term
                    “Vendor” or “Partner”. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing this Agreement. bitegarden’s
                    failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of bitegarden’s
                    rights to subsequently enforce the provision. bitegarden may freely assign, transfer, and delegate
                    its rights and obligations under this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that bitegarden’s
                    affiliates, contractors and service providers may exercise all rights of bitegarden under this
                    Agreement, including bitegarden’s license rights. You may not assign any of your rights or
                    obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without bitegarden’s
                    prior written consent, except that you may assign all of your rights and obligations under this
                    Agreement to any corporation or other entity without consent in connection with a merger or the sale
                    of all or substantially all of your assets as long as (1) you give bitegarden written notice of any
                    such assignment at least ten business days before such assignment and (2) the assignee agrees in
                    writing to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement; however, in the event that
                    bitegarden determines that such assignment is to a competitor of bitegarden, bitegarden may terminate
                    this Agreement upon notice to you. Subject to the foregoing limitations, this Agreement will be
                    binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
                    successors and assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
                    respect to its subject matter, supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between
                    the parties with respect to its subject matter, and does not give any third party (except where
                    specified) any rights or remedies hereunder. Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder
                    will be in writing and given (i) by bitegarden via email, via a posting in the Marketplace
                    Guidelines, via the Marketplace Portal, or (ii)
                    by you via email to legal@bitegarden.com or to such other email or physical addresses as bitegarden
                    may specify from time to time. The date of receipt will, in the case of email, be deemed the date on
                    which such notice is transmitted.
