In <span style="color: green">bitegarden</span>, we’re taking a step forward today: we’re launching the bitegarden Marketplace in beta, a space designed for the SonarQube™ Server and SonarQube™ Cloud community, where developers, partners, and companies can connect, share, and discover solutions that truly add value.

<img width="100%" src="/img/posts/bitegarden-marketplace-home.png" alt="Home bitegarden Marketplace"> <br><br>

The [bitegarden Marketplace](https://marketplace.bitegarden.com/) was created with a clear goal: to help you get the most out of your SonarQube™. Here, you can download both the products and plugins developed by bitegarden and the solutions created by third parties from the [Sonar](https://sonarsource.com/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} ecosystem. Everything is in one place, designed to help you improve your code’s quality, security, and metric management quickly and efficiently.

If you’re a **developer or create extensions for SonarQube™**, this Marketplace is your stage. Publishing here means your ideas can reach more teams within an active community committed to continuous improvement. Each plugin or extension contributes to an ecosystem **where excellence and collaboration are the priority**.

For teams using SonarQube™, the bitegarden Marketplace offers **solutions that extend your instance’s capabilities**, centralizing features that were previously scattered and helping you analyze and manage the metrics that truly matter. From improving code security to optimizing analysis efficiency, everything is designed to make your workflow smoother and your code stronger.

Developers can learn from other partners and collaborate so that the Sonar community **continues to grow and evolve**. And development teams can discover new solutions that help them enhance their workflow and results without complications.

Now, bitegarden’s SonarQube plugins can be downloaded both from this website and from the bitegarden Marketplace.

There’s still much to do, but the **bitegarden Marketplace** in beta is already a meeting point for those looking to innovate, collaborate, and take code quality to the next level. If you are interested in publishing a product, get in contact with us and become part of this new stage.
