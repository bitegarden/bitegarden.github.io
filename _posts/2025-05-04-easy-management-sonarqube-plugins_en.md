Are you a SonarQube&trade; administrator? Then this article is for you. At bitegarden, we’ve developed a solution built by developers, for administrators: the **Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) for SonarQube&trade;**. In this article, we’ll show you how this product can make your day-to-day plugin management tasks much easier.

<h2>What is the Universal Plugin Manager?</h2>

The Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) is an administration tool that **simplifies plugin management** within your SonarQube&trade; instance. It is designed to streamline plugin installation, updating, and removal, allowing administrators to manage everything from within the SonarQube&trade; administration interface — with no need to access the server file system.

Traditionally, installing a custom plugin in SonarQube&trade; meant copying .jar files directly into the server's extensions/plugins folder, which required help from the operations team.

With our UPM plugin, you can save time by performing the **following actions**:

➡ Upload .jar files **directly** through the web interface.

➡ Install any custom plugin or older version not available in the **SonarQube&trade; Marketplace**.

<h2>Featured bitegarden plugins</h2>

One of the most powerful features of UPM is the dedicated section for **bitegarden-developed plugins**. From here, you can:

➡ Browse all our plugins **compatible with SonarQube&trade;**.

➡ Install and update our tools **directly from within UPM**.

➡ Easily **uninstall any plugin** you no longer need.

In addition, the Universal Plugin Manager **includes an auto-update feature**. It will notify you when a new version is available, so your system stays up to date effortlessly.

<h2>Why choose bitegarden's Universal Plugin Manager?</h2>

Here are just a few of the **benefits you'll enjoy**:

➡ Save time and reduce dependency on your operations team.

➡ Manage all your plugins from a single place.

➡ Ideal for enterprise environments and on-premise configurations.

➡ Full support for custom and third-party plugins.

➡ One-click installation and updates.
