We have a new release of Control Center for SonarQube! In this article, we’ll share what you can find in version 1.5.

<h2>What are the new features?</h2>
This new version includes a new area where you can filter through all the Users in the instance, whether by their name, login, external provider, or external identity.

Additionally, we’ve added a search bar to make it easier to find the user you’re looking for!
If you haven't tried this product in your SonarQube instance yet, you can download the free version through [this link](/sonarqube-control-center-trial-form)
