## New Feature

Now the plugin is able to do the **compliance verification** following the most current standard, instead of the CWE / SANS Top 25 ranking of the *year 2011*, included in the standard version of SonarQube.

The Security Plugin, as with the OWASP standard, will show you a page in the project space with all the information related to the CWE Top 25 of 2020, including rating, vulnerabilities, security hotspots, etc.
