If you want to **export reports of quality profiles** and their active rules, the **Report Plugin for SonarQube** makes it easy. Since version 2.22, this feature has been available, and in this article, we’ll show you step by step how to take full advantage of it.

<h2>Step 1: Download the Report Plugin for SonarQube</h2>

To get started, download the **Report Plugin for SonarQube** via this [link](/sonarqube-report-trial-form)

We also recommend checking the installation instructions. You’ll see that completing this step is very simple and quick.

<h2>Step 2: Generate Quality Profile Reports</h2>

Once the installation is complete, you can generate your report of quality profiles and active rules by following these steps:

Access your **SonarQube instance**.

Click on the **More > Rules Reporting** tab. To help you locate it, here’s an example image:

<br> <br>

When you access **Rules Reporting**, a window will open where you need to select:

- The **language** for which you want to export active rules.

- The **quality profile** for which you want to generate the report.

In the example above, Java was selected as the language and Sonar way as the quality profile.

<h2>Step 3: Download the Report</h2>

That’s it! Once you’ve selected the parameters, click the **Download** button.

A PDF file will be downloaded that you can read, save, and share. Here’s an example of the first two pages:

The **Report Plugin for SonarQube Server** is very useful not only for exporting reports of quality profiles and their active rules but also for understanding the quality status of your code. By following the installation steps, selecting the language and quality profile, and downloading the report, you’ll have all the key information quickly and easily.

This feature allows you to improve traceability, documentation, and control of your development projects, facilitating team communication and ensuring that established quality standards are met.
