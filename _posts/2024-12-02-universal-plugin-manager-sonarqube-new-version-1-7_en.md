New features for our **Universal Plugin Manager for SonarQube**!

In this **version 1.7**, the bitegarden development team has added a new functionality. This is a **new section called 'Marketplace'** in which you can search for third-party plugins. When you click on that section you can search for products through a list that will appear or you can find them thanks to a **new search bar**. 

Here we leave you a picture of how the Universal Plugin Manager for SonarQube was until now.

In this image you can see how it is from **version 1.7**.
