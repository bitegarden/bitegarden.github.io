We have a new version of the [bitegarden Report for SonarCloud](/sonarcloud-report)!

This version removes that 4 reports:
- Vulnerabilities, Bugs and Code Smells Summary Report
- Security Hotspots Summary Report
- Vulnerabilities, Bugs and Code Smells Breakdown Report
- Security Hotspots Breakdown Report

<br/>

Also, we have modified the parameters, to permit provide the **Issue Types** and **Security Hotspots** that we want to retrieve in chosen report.

That parameter is called "sonar.types" and we can provide that possible values, comma-separated:
- BUG
- VULNERABILITY
- CODE_SMELL
- SECURITY_HOTSPOT

<br/>
