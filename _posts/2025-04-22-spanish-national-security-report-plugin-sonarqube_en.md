Information security is a core requirement in the digital transformation of the public sector. In Spain, the Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS) is the legal <strong>framework designed to protect the systems and services</strong> that handle public data.

If you work with or for a government entity, compliance with the ENS is not optional. In this article, we explain what the ENS is, why it matters, and how our <strong>Report Plugin for SonarQube™</strong> can help you easily generate the technical documentation required for security audits and ENS compliance.

<h2>What is the National Security Framework (ENS)?</h2>

The ENS, regulated by <strong>Decreto Ley 311/2022</strong>, establishes the minimum principles and security requirements that must be implemented by public administrations in Spain, as well as by third-party providers that process public data.

The ENS is based on <strong>five core principles</strong>:

- Confidentiality

- Integrity

- Availability

- Authenticity

- Traceability

These principles translate into a set of technical and organizational <strong>security measures, applied based on the system's criticality level (basic, medium, or high)</strong>.

<h2>Why is ENS important for your organization?</h2>

- It’s a legal obligation for all public sector entities.

- It builds trust in your digital services.

- It is required for security audits and certification processes.

- It’s a key requirement for public procurement and IT tenders.

<h2>How does SonarQube™ support ENS compliance?</h2>

SonarQube™ is widely used in the public sector to:

- Monitor and improve source code quality.

- Detect vulnerabilities and security issues.

- Ensure traceability of software development processes.

- Generate documentation for best practices and compliance.

In the ENS context, this provides technical evidence that supports your Security Plan, Audit Reports, and Statement of Applicability.

<h2>How report plugin for SonarQube™ helps with ENS compliance</h2>

Our <strong>Report Plugin for SonarQube™</strong>, allows you to generate customizable, comprehensive reports in PDF and ODT formats, containing all the key data from your SonarQube™ project analysis.

<h3>What can you include in the reports?</h3>

- Quality metrics (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells)

- Code coverage and duplication statistics

- Technical debt and rule compliance status

- Project/module breakdowns and traceability

- Historical reports for audit tracking

<h3>Why is this useful for ENS?</h3>

- Generates technical evidence on demand

- Automates the documentation process

- Supports the ENS traceability principle

- Facilitates internal and external audit reviews

Complying with the <strong>National Security Framework (ENS)</strong> doesn’t have to be a complex task. With tools like Report Plugin for SonarQube™, you can ensure your code is secure, traceable, and well-documented — ready for any audit or review.

If you're looking for a smart way to streamline ENS compliance, try our [Plugin for SonarQube™](/sonarqube-report) and turn your project analysis into professional, audit-ready documentation.
