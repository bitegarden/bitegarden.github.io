We have a new version of our product **Security Report for SonarQube Cloud&trade;**! As part of our ongoing commitment to help you strengthen the security of your software, we are excited to announce a new feature in our plugin for SonarQube Cloud version.

We have launched **version 1.7**, which includes a new report. Specifically, you can now generate a PDF report that includes vulnerabilities classified as On the Cusp from the CWE Top 25.

<h2>What is the CWE Top 25 On the Cusp?</h2>

The **CWE Top 25 On the Cusp** includes vulnerabilities ranked between positions 26-40 according to the **2024 CWE Top 25 Methodology**. While these may not be the top 25 most dangerous, teams responsible for mitigation and risk management should still consider these additional weaknesses, as they can also evolve into severe vulnerabilities.

<h2>Download the new version</h2>

You can download this new version 1.7 from the [product page](/sonarcloud-security) of the **Security Plugin for SonarQube Cloud&trade;**.
