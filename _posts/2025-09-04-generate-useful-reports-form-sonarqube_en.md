SonarQube is an essential tool for development teams looking to ensure **code quality and security**. Its analysis system provides valuable insights into bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, test coverage, and other key indicators. However, when it’s time to share this information with other teams, business stakeholders, or during audits, the standard report SonarQube offers often falls short.

Have you ever needed to prepare a **detailed report** and ended up manually exporting data, taking screenshots, or creating documents from scratch? This task can be slow, repetitive, and error-prone.

In this article, we’ll explore how to generate more comprehensive and useful **reports directly from SonarQube**, thanks to two bitegarden plugins that let you simplify this process: Report Plugin for SonarQube&trade; Server and Report for SonarQube&trade; Cloud.

<h2>Report Plugin for SonarQube&trade; Server</h2>

The **Report Plugin for SonarQube&trade; Server** is a product developed by bitegarden that allows you to download reports in multiple formats (PDF, ODT, etc.), with fully detailed information about your projects’ quality. Specifically, you can generate the following reports:

- Executive summary with all metrics on a single page.

- Evidence summary.

- Full evidence report.

The reports included in SonarQube are useful for a quick overview of code quality, but they have some limitations when you need a customized document. This is where bitegarden’s plugins come into play, extending SonarQube’s capabilities and allowing you to **automate the generation of professional reports**.

Here’s an example of the report you can generate with Report Plugin for SonarQube&trade; Server.
