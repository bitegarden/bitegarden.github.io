Do you use SonarQube and need to export professional reports on your code quality? Not satisfied with the native report provided by SonarQube?

Then the **Report Plugin for SonarQube™** by bitegarden is the tool you’ve been looking for.

<h2>What is Report Plugin for SonarQube™?</h2>

The **Report Plugin for SonarQube™** is a professional plugin that allows you to export detailed and customizable reports on your code quality directly from the SonarQube™ interface. No complex setup. No external tools required.

With this plugin, you can:

1. Download ready-to-share PDF reports. <br>

2. Generate editable documents from custom ODT templates.   <br>

3. Save time preparing audit reports.   <br>

4. Export clear, clean, and professional information about the quality status of any project (and any branch) in your SonarQube™ instance.   <br>

While **SonarQube** provides a basic report to view a project’s quality status, many teams face limitations when it comes to customizing content or presenting information clearly and in a way that fits their needs.

With the **Report Plugin for SonarQube™**, you can go one step further: generate clean, complete, and fully customizable executive reports in both PDF and ODT formats—aligned with your branding, style, or audit requirements.

Here you can see the difference between the two reports.

<h2>Why choose the Report Plugin for SonarQube?</h2>

Beyond the visual differences shown above, here are the **key benefits of the plugin**:

1. Save time and effort on technical documentation.   <br>

2. Customize content with full flexibility (choose exactly what information to export).   <br>

3. Export what you need, when you need it.   <br>

4. Compatible with multiple branches and programming languages.   <br>
