We released the **version 2.27** of [Security Plugin for SonarQube](sonarqube-security)!
<br/>

This release includes new options for the ASVS report. Users will now be able to see a report both on the plugin page and in PDF filtered by requirement levels. You can configure these options from the tab **Administration -> bitegarden Security -> OWASP ASVS**.

Here is an image to show you these new options:
