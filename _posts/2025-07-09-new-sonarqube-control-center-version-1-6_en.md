We're excited to announce a new release of **Control Center for SonarQube™**, one of our most popular plugins for SonarQube administrators. This update includes key improvements in project management that will make your work easier, more efficient, and more organized.

<h2>What’s new in this version?</h2>

In this new version of **Control Center for SonarQube™**, we’ve added two features that were highly requested by our users:

- **Tag filtering**: You can now filter the project list by tag name or by the absence of tags, making it easier to identify unclassified projects.

- **Bulk rename tags**: From the “Bulk Actions” section, you can rename tags across multiple projects at once, helping keep your SonarQube instance well organized.

These improvements are especially useful for those managing large project portfolios who need an efficient classification and maintenance system.

<h2>What is Control Center for SonarQube™?</h2>

As a reminder, **Control Center for SonarQube™** is a plugin that helps administrators **manage their SonarQube instance in a bulk and visual way**. From a single dashboard, you can quickly view essential data about all your projects, users, and resolved hotspots.

This plugin allows you to:

• Easily search and filter projects.

• View aggregated statistics by language, lines of code, or analysis date.

• Perform bulk actions like tagging projects.

• Manage users and resolved hotspots without comments.

If you **manage a SonarQube™ instance**, this plugin is essential to stay organized and make data-driven decisions.
