We have a new version of our product: Report Plugin for SonarQube Server 2.22.

In this update, we have added **one of the most requested features** by our users: the ability to **generate detailed reports of quality profiles** and their active rules directly **from SonarQube Server**.

Although SonarQube already centralizes all this information, there is often a need for formal documentation to share with other teams, vendors, or even security auditors. Having an **exportable and well-structured document** is key to demonstrating the maturity of software quality processes.

<h2>What's included in version 2.22</h2>

The new version of Report Plugin for SonarQube Server 2.22 allows you to:

Generate **automatic reports** of the quality profiles configured in SonarQube. <br>

**List the active rules** of each profile, organized by security, hotspots, reliability, and maintainability. <br>

<h2>How can I get a Quality Gates report?</h2>

To use this new functionality of the Report Plugin for SonarQube Server, follow these steps:

1. Go to the More tab in the main menu. <br>

2. Access the new Rules Reporting section. <br>

3. In the window that opens, select the language and the Quality Gate for which you want the report. <br>

4. Click the Download button. <br>

Here is an image showing exactly where this new feature is located.

And here is an example of the **first two pages** of a report that exported the quality profiles for the Java language:
