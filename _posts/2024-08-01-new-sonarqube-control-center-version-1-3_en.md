We have a new release of Control Center for SonarQube! In this article you will find what you can find in this **version 1.3**.

<h2>What are the new functionalities? </h2>

This new version includes a **new section** where all users of the instance can be viewed and allows you to **change the identity provider** that you have configured, either for a single user or multiple users at once.

In the following image you can see an example of this **new functionality**:

Here you can see how a user **will be able to select one or more users** and change the provider at the same time:
